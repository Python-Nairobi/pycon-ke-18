##The call for volunteers is on!

Hi! Thanks for your interest in becoming a volunteer for PyConKE 2017.
The spirit of volunteerism is what makes the Python community and tech
events like PyCon distinctly inspiring. We need all the help we can get :)
Volunteership is grouped into the following areas/teams:

  - Pre-event training (teaching Python through music, animation, and web training)
  - Logistics
  - Fundraising
  - Marketing & Community relations
  - Graphics & Web Design
  - Programs (workshops, talks, etc)

Once you've decided which team(s) you'd like to help with, please fill out
the form below and we'll get in touch with you as soon as we can. Note that
volunteer slots per team are limited so we might put you on a wait-list if
the volunteer limit for the committee you signed up for has already been
reached.

In addition to this feel free to join:

  - Python Nairobi Meetup group: https://www.meetup.com/Python-Nairobi/
  - Telegram: https://telegram.me/pythonKE
  - Mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ke
