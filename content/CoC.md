enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and
courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially
sponsored by PyConKE or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any PyConKE
event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code
throughout the event.

PyConKE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different
backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist,
racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyConKE.
